# Termux

Termux is an Android terminal application and Linux environment, which can also run code-server from your phone.

## Installation

1. Install Termux from [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux/)
2. Make sure it's up-to-date by running `apt update && apt upgrade`
3. Install required packages: `apt install build-essential python git nodejs yarn`
4. Install code-server: `yarn global add code-server`
5. Run code-server: `code-server` and navigate to localhost:8080 in your browser

## Change Password

```bash
nano ~/.config/code-server/config.yaml
```

## Run

```bash
code-server
```

## Stop 

```
Ctrl+C
```

## Upgrading

To upgrade run: `yarn global upgrade code-server --latest`

## Known Issues

### Search issue

There is a known issue with search not working on Android because it's missing `bin/rg`. To fix:

1. Install `ripgrep` with `pkg`
   ```sh
   pkg install ripgrep
   ```
2. Make a soft link using `ln -s`

```sh
# run this command inside the code-server directory
ln -s $PREFIX/bin/rg ./lib/vscode/node_modules/vscode-ripgrep/bin/rg
```

For more context, see [comment](https://github.com/cdr/code-server/issues/1730#issuecomment-721515979).

### Backspace not working

There is a known issue with the backspace key not working correctly when using the on-screen keyboard on Android. This is due to an upstream issue. Read more:

- [Issues with Backspace in Codespaces on Android (Surface Duo)](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/107602)
- [Support mobile platforms](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/issues/1101)

Workaround: use a Bluetooth keyboard.
